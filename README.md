# pfast-and-pfurious
Scraper and ML based data analysis for shuttle times.

The main file here is the phantomjs scraper file (transloc_scraper.js) this file when run with phantomjs will continuously log (to stdout for now) the positions of every shuttle from the live feed given by harvard.transloc.com. 

The Python file is a test (though still minimally functional if you want to play with it) Ignore it.
